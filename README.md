Hub for works I've done in school or in my free time.  Mainly Java, will specify if it's non-Java.

Descriptions:

A0X:

All works starting with A0X (X being 1-6) are from my CSIS 2420 - Data Structures & Algorithms course, Spring 2018.  This course delved into creating many different programs (The A0X programs being the most comprehensive exercises) and creating them not only correctly, but as efficiently as possible, using very little processing power to achieve the greatest results.  All A0X assignments were created in a group setting with Dillon Embreus, another student in the class who I got along with well for the entire semester.  Together, we were able to create some really cool stuff.

  A01 - Perc

    Percolation assignment

    The goal of percolation is to create a grid of squares, each square is either blocked, open, or filled.  We want to know when the filled squares have reached from the top of the grid to the bottom, as if we were pouring water down and opening up sites for it to fill into until it reaches the bottom.
     
Recommended is to first run PercolationVisualizer.java, which will create a 50x50 grid which you can then click to open up sites (Click and drag works, here, try it out!).  After you've seen how the program works visually, run the Percolation.java to really see the efficiency in action.  By default, it is set to run a 50x50 grid 10,000 times, opening sites at random until the grid percolates, then recording the mean percentage of sites required to open before percolating, and even including a standard deviation and high and low confidences of how many sites will need to be opened to percolate.
     
Reflection of assignment -- 
     A challenging first assignment, Percolation really started to nail home what Java is all about, and how powerful it can be.
